A few months ago, 
[Manta network](https://manta.network) received the Web3 Foundation's [Open Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program) to build a decentralized anonymous payment system for Polkadot.
As part of the milestone 1 deliverables of this program, 
we are open-sourcing our code [pallat-manta-dap](https://github.com/Manta-Network/pallet-manta-dap/tree/w3f-deliverable-mods), [manta-node](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-node) and [manta-front-end](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-front-end).
