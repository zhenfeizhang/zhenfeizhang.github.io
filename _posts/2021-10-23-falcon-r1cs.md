I recently worked on a [rust wrapper](https://github.com/zhenfeizhang/falcon.rs) of the reference implementation for Falcon signature scheme. Also [a rank-1 constraint system (R1CS) implementation
of Falcon](https://github.com/zhenfeizhang/falcon-r1cs) which shows falcon's signature can be verified
with some __80k__ r1cs constraints. The main ingredient is an almost linear time NTT based multiplication
circuit that performs ring multiplications with __15k__ constraints.
