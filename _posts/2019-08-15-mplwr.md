This year's [_Asiacript 2019_](https://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2019/) accepts 
my paper with Shi Bai, Katharina Boudgoust, Dipayan Das, Adeline Roux-Langlois and Weiqiang Wen,
__Middle-Product Learning with Rounding Problem and its Applications__.
Here is the [manuscript](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1001).
This is somewhat an extension of [my last year's Asiacrypt paper](https://zhenfeizhang.github.io/2018-08-13-rclwrpaper/).
