I just gave a talk at [NIST's second PQC Standardization Conference](https://csrc.nist.gov/events/2019/second-pqc-standardization-conference) today on recent updates of the [LAC cryptosystem](https://github.com/luxianhui007/LAC) that colleagues and I are working on. The slides can be found [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/lac-round-2-presentation/images-media/lac-zhang.pdf) and [here](../../talks/nist-lac-2019.pdf).
