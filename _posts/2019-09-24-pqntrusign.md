title: pqNTRUSign paper finally got accepted...
tags: [paper]

pqNTRUSign is a lattice based, same-key aggregatable signature scheme.
After three years of revision,
during which period, the scheme has been [submitted to](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/Round-1-Submissions),
and rejected by, [NIST PQC standardization process](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography),
the pqNTRUSign paper is finally accepted for publication by [Design, Codes and Cryptography](https://link.springer.com/journal/10623).
In this paper, we finally come up with a proof for the existential unforgeablity of the signature,
based on the short integer solution (SIS) problems over certain structured lattices.
