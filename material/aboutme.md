title: About me
---
I am 

- an engineer at [Scroll](https://scroll.io/);
- a researcher at [Ethereum Foundation](https://crypto.ethereum.org/team);
- an advisor for [Cysic](https://cysic.xyz/) and [Modulus Labs](https://www.moduluslabs.xyz/).

Previously I worked for (listed Alphabetically): [Algorand](https://algorand.com), [Espresso](https://www.espressosys.com/),
[Manta](https://manta.network/), and a couple of non-web3 companies.
I also received grants from [Polkadot](https://web3.foundation/) and [Mina](https://minaprotocol.com/).

 of the [Ethereum Foundation](https://crypto.ethereum.org/team), and 
a staff cryptography engineer at a stealth startup.
Prior to that,
I was a co-founder and the CTO of [Manta network](https://manta.network/); 
I worked for [Ant Group](https://www.ant-group.com), [Algorand](https://algorand.com),
and [OnBoard Security Inc](https://www.onboardsecurity.com/).
I received my Ph.D. from
[University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/) in 2014.

My research interests are in lattice based cryptography. 

My engineering interests are in practical ZKP systems and efficient cryptography primitives. -->

<!-- 
I worked on cryptography for blockchains and contributed to [several cryptographic libraries](https://zhenfeizhang.github.io/material/projects/).  I am also involved in __2__ out of 7 [NIST PQC finalists](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions): [NTRU](https://ntru.org)
and [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/).
My main research area has been lattice-based
cryptography, NTRU cryptosystems, fully homomorphic
encryptions, and zero knowledge proof systems. -->

My [Erdos number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_by_Erd≈ës_number) is __3__.
